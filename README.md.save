In Progress
I currently have no theme or dotfiles which I create. Right now I'm using gh0stk dotfile https://github.com/gh0stzk/dotfiles for my bspwm config and JaKooLit https://github.com/JaKooLit/Arch-Hyprland and his https://github.com/JaKooLit/Hyprland-Dots for my hyprland config.

This repository will only cover script which I made and some configuration I modify to better fit my needs.
